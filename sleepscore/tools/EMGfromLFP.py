"""
Derive EMG from LFP through correlation of highfrequency activity.

This code is basically a Python translation and readaptation of the
bz_EMGFromLFP.m function from Buzsaki's lab.
(`https://github.com/buzsakilab/buzcode/blob/master/detectors/bz_EMGFromLFP.m`).
Based on Erik Schomburg's and code and work, published in `Theta Phase
Segregation of Input-Specific Gamma Patterns in Entorhinal-Hippocampal Networks,
Schomburg et al., Neuron 2014.
